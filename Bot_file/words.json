They don't possess general intelligence or consciousness.\nExamples include voice assistants, image recognition software, and chatbots.\n\n(b) General or Strong AI (AGI): These hypothetical systems would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.\nAGI does not yet exist and remains a subject of research and speculation.\nArtificial Intelligence has numerous applications across various industries, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and transportation, and it continues to evolve and shape the future of technology and human-machine interaction.\n"]
